## Release 4: Design your own Schema
Description of what you're modeling: 
This is a schema for family members' identification where the attributes in the second table are optional.

This is a schema for a database of students where each student can have up to four guardians, and each guardian may have multiple phone numbers. The guardians and their numbers are in separate tables because some guardians may be linked to several students, and some phone numbers may be shared.

## Release 5: Reflection
What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?
- Went fairly smoothly.

What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
- I had to look up how to link an image in a markdown file. (https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/STASH/Markdown+syntax+guide)

What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?
- It took me a few tries to wrap my head around the idea of having a table dedicated to the attributes of the field within a different table.

Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
- n/a

How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?
- Moderate

Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
- I like the organizational aspect of outlining the schemas

Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
- Was incredibly tedious when I'd notice that I'd made an error in a schema and have to go back and build the whole thing again.
