## U3.W7: SQLZoo

####I worked on this challenge by myself.



### My Quiz Results:

I did the exercises and completed the quizzes, reviewing each one until I'd answered all of the questions correctly and understood them. Unfortunately, it seems that I was logged out before completing most of the exercises and quizzes, because when I went to take a screenshot of my test results, they were only there for the SELECT activities. I hereby do solemnly swear that I did all of the required materials and tests; I will not be re-doing them for the sake of providing the scores. :-)





### Reflection
Feeling pretty strong about SQL, which I've worked with in the past. The refresher was nice.
