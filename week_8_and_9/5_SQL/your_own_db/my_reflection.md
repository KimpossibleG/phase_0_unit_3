Reflection:

From what I understand, the FOREIGN KEY needs to be created at the same time as the table is being created in this version of sqlite. Because the instructions that I understood to mean 'create foreign key' weren't until the Release AFTER the create-tables release, I ended up having to drop the whole second table I made and re-create it in order to add the foreign key. Lesson learned!

This was a pretty straightforward exercise, and one that I'm glad that I did. Feeling like I can handle this concept pretty well, although pulling data via SQL will take some more practice.
